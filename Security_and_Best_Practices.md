# Security and Best Practices

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for **BitTicket** to ensure safe transactions, data integrity, and platform stability.

## Security Principles

1. **Least Privilege Access**

   * Restrict access to only the necessary components.
   * Enforce role-based access control for sensitive operations.

2. **Data Encryption**

   * Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all network communications.
   * Encrypt sensitive data stored locally and in transit.

3. **Input Validation**

   * Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent SQL Injection, XSS, and other attacks.
   * Use libraries like `validator` or built-in functions for proper checks.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**

   * Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication.
   * Verify ownership of tickets through blockchain verification before granting access.

5. **Transaction Security**

   * Use multi-signature wallets for event organizers to prevent unauthorized spending.
   * Enforce time-locks on ticket sales to prevent double-spending.

6. **Secure APIs**

   * Protect API endpoints with proper authentication.
   * Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks.

7. **Error Handling**

   * Avoid exposing stack traces or internal logic in error messages.
   * Log errors securely without revealing sensitive information.

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**

   * Use Git for version control and always create feature branches for changes.
   * Apply code reviews before merging to the main branch.

2. **Documentation and Testing**

   * Write clear documentation for all modules.
   * Implement unit and integration tests for critical paths.

3. **Backup and Recovery**

   * Schedule regular database backups.
   * Test recovery plans periodically.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**

   * Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track API health.
   * Maintain logs for auditing and debugging purposes.

5. **Dependency Management**

   * Regularly update npm dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
   * Avoid using deprecated or unmaintained libraries.

6. **Deployment Security**

   * Use Docker for isolated and consistent deployments.
   * Apply firewall rules to restrict access to services.

## Future Improvements

* Introduce hardware security modules (HSM) for key management.
* Implement decentralized identity verification (DID) for secure user authentication.
* Add advanced anomaly detection for ticket sales and transactions.
