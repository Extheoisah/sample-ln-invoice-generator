# BitTicket Documentation

A decentralized ticketing platform powered by Bitcoin, allowing event organizers to create and manage events with Bitcoin-based tickets. Each ticket is cryptographically tied to a verifiable Bitcoin transaction, enabling secure ownership verification, resale, and fraud prevention.

# Overview

BitTicket is designed to:

* Create and manage events with Bitcoin-based ticketing.
* Generate and verify tickets using Bitcoin transactions.
* Handle ticket payments via the Lightning Network or on-chain transactions.
* Enable secure ticket resale and transfers.
* Verify ticket ownership using blockchain explorers.
* Build a modern UI for event discovery and ticket management.

│   │   ├── [id]/          # Event details page
│   │   └── page.tsx       # Event listing
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── EventCard.tsx  # Displays individual event details
│   │   ├── TicketCard.tsx # Displays ticket information
│   │   └── NavBar.tsx     # Navigation bar component
│   ├── layout.tsx         # Main layout configuration
│   └── page.tsx           # Landing page

## Deployment Steps

### **1️⃣ Deploy on Vercel (Front-end):**

* Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
* Configure environment variables for LND and Bitcoin nodes.
* Deploy the project.

### **2️⃣ Deploy LND and Bitcoin Nodes:**

* Use Docker or a VPS to set up LND and Bitcoin Core.
* Ensure both nodes are accessible via the internet if deploying globally.

### **3️⃣ Configure Front-end to Use Public Endpoints:**

* Update `lnd.ts` and `bitcoin.ts` with public endpoints if necessary.

### **4️⃣ Monitor and Test:**

* Use tools like `lncli` for LND and `bitcoin-cli` for Bitcoin Core to test connectivity.
